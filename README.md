# Probabilistic-Stellar-Classifier(On Going)
Machine learning project where we train a model to classify a star or a celestial using Bayesian statistics and a key factor involved in this is how uncertain our model is and provide reasoning behind it.
- The algorithm used to in the training process --> KNN.
- The data required for this model is sourced from SDSS
